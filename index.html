                <p>Come out and join hundreds of your fellow developers and friends
                as we celebrate another fantastic year of communal growth with food
                and drinks.</p>

                <p>The Nashville developer community is doing some amazing things. Over the past
                few years, we've started and grown over 30 active user groups with thousands of 
                members. We have setup three major conferences bringing out thousands more, both
                local and nationally. Finally, we've created a hackathon that is dominating
                the Southeast and is a model for bringing people together to make awesome
                things for both play and work.</p>

                <p>Because of all this, we're excited to invite you all out to join us as 
                we celebrate another year of awesome during our 3rd annual Joint User Group
                Holiday party. This party is for anyone who slings code, especially those
                of us who partake regularly in one or more of the monthly user groups.</p>
