            <h1>Extended CodeConf's Call for Papers Details for Nashville</h1>
            <h2>To help insure Nashville developers have the opportunity to submit papers, Github has extended the CfP deadline by 2 weeks.</h2>
            <p>We're searching for the best talks that the open source community has to offer. We'd like opinionated, thoughtful, and compelling sessions that will leave everyone that attends thinking differently about the open source ecosystem. At CodeConf, if you come with an open mind, you'll leave a better contributor.</p>

            <p>We welcome speakers with all level of experience, whether it's your first talk or your fiftieth. We are also actively seeking a diverse line-up of speakers across all dimensions. We are happy to make ourselves available for any questions as you go through the application process. Contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:events@github.com">events@github.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Before submitting a session, please familiarize yourself with the conference code of conduct.</p>

            <h4>Topic inspiration</h4>

            <p>We are looking for a wide range of topics from all over the community. The list below is just inspiration, but we're open to all of your wonderful ideas.</p>

            <p>Collaboration, diversity, teams, and community.<br />
            UX, design, and front-end technologies.<br />
            Object-oriented, functional, and reactive programming.<br />
            Microservices, distributed systems, and resilience.<br />
            Game development including engines, frameworks, libraries.<br />
            Security and privacy.<br />
            Legal and policy issues including compliance, licensing, net neutrality.<br />
            Documentation, education, and onboarding.<br />
            Session format</p>

            <p>We will be choosing sessions that highlight various points of view. When possible, we will choose multiple talks examining the issue from different angles. We don't intend to start a debate club, but competing and complimentary opinions are equally welcome. Your session should be concise and focused, no history lessons or overviews, as each session is a succinct 20 minutes.</p>

            <h4>Speaker compensation</h4>

            <p>All speakers will receive admission to CodeConf and all activities. For those speakers that do not already have corporate sponsorship of their speaking engagements, we will offer travel compensation. If you fall into this category and your talk is accepted, you will receive:</p>

            <p>3 nights of hotel accommodation (June 24th, 25th, and 26th, 2015)</br>
            Economy airfare reimbursement for domestic US travel</br>
            Up to $500 stipend for international travel</br>
            We will make every effort to make the conference available to all speakers, if your talk is selected please inform us of any accessibility, childcare, or other needs you may have.</p>

            <h4>Selection process</h4>

            <p>Talks will be initially blind reviewed by a panel of GitHub employees and open source community members. Speaker information will be used in any final reviews necessary to break ties and bring a balance to the speakers. The Call for Proposals closes April 30, 2015 at 11:59pm PST. Speakers will be notified of selection by May 7, 2015.</p>
